This is easy to make and only has a handful of ingredients. it takes minimal skill and experience, mostly stiring endlessly to ensure all the sugar has discolved into the water again and again endless sitr after stire until the very life saps out of you and you wonder if this cup of tea is really worth it.

Here are some examples of what a post with images might look like. If you want to display two or three images next to each other responsively use `figure` with the appropriate `class`. Each instance of `figure` is auto-numbered and displayed in the caption.



## ingreadients

<ul>
<li> Tea - 1 tbsp </li>
<li> sugar </li>
</ul> 

## Method

![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-150x150.jpg){: .align-left} 

Step 1) Add the tea to the water and stire then add the milk and stir again making sure that all the sugar is mixed in well. at this point you may be tempted to stop but keep stiring until all the sugar has disolved into the water. then take a rest

Step 2) if you need another method with picture then alternate the images from side to side. once again stiring making sure that all the sugar is mixed in well. at this point you may be tempted to stop but keep stiring until all the sugar has disolved into the water. then take a rest 

Step 3) for methods that dont need a picture then just add them into the mix

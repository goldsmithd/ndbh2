This is easy to make and only has a few readily available ingredients. There are two options but the one with the potato top isn’t really a pie and more resembles a cottage pie, still delicious though!

## Method

**Step 1)** Cook lentils – cover with water and bring to the boil then let simmer for around 20 mins. <br>

**Step 2)** Make the gravy - crumble the veg stock cube and add the gravy granules into around 1 pint, or more if you like. Microwave for 2 mins and stir then microwave for another minute when you are going to add to the lentils.<br>

**Step 3)** Add beans - once the lentils are cooked add the beans, I always drain first because they come with preservative water in most tins which you do not need. If you are using potatoes then mash these with the Almond milk or you can use margarine if you wish.<br>

**Step 4)** Add carrots and peas - Chop carrots finely, no need to peel them just a quick scrub and top and tail them add to lentils, add the garden peas, these can be straight from frozen.<br>

**Step 5)** Seasoning - add the seasoning to the mixture and stir well, feel free to add different amounts and types.

**Step 6)** decant into pie containers or use cookwear or thing that will be an appropriate oven/freezer proof container. Add the lids and decorate with whatever design you wish.

**Step 7)** cook for around 30 mins or so on around 180degrees for a fan oven or 200degrees for a conventional oven. Any left over pies can be frozen prior to cooking. Serve with loads of Veg and the left over gravy.

These pie's are very filling and because you can batch make them they are a good thing to pull out of the freezer as and when needed.

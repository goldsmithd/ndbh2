**Step 1)** Make the Flax Egg, this is simply either flaxseed or chai seed and water, I use 1 dessertspoon of flaxseed and 3 dessertspoons of water. Add boiling water to the flaxseed and mix well. then leave to cool..<br>

**Step 2)** Chop the Onion and then pulse in a food mixer. I am not very keen on Onions so I make this really fine but you may like it chunky !<br>

**Step 3)** Add the beans and pulse or mix until you have either a fine or coarse bean mixture. My food processor seemed to produce a mixture of both consistencies <br>



**Step 5)** Seasoning - add the seasoning to the mixture and stir well, feel free to add different amounts and types. the stiring didnt work well in the food mixer so I put the ingredients in a bowl and sired by hand. <br>

**Step 6)** Make the burgers by hand, to get the same about per burger I used 2 large dessertspoons of mixture per burger and then formed by hand. <br>

These burgers are packed with beans, the clue is in the name ! Batch make them they are a good thing to pull out of the freezer as and when needed.
